# Installation

Use your favorite package manager to install any of the packages and save to your `package.json`:

# Or, if you prefer yarn
$ yarn add @slack/web-api @slack/oauth
```

## Requirements

This package supports Node v14 and higher. It's highly recommended to use [the latest LTS version of
node](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#release-schedule), and the documentation is written using syntax and features
from that version.
