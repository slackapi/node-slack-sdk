# Interface: DateTimepicker

## Description

Allows users to select both a date and a time of day, formatted as a Unix timestamp. On desktop
clients, this time picker will take the form of a dropdown list and the date picker will take the form of a dropdown
calendar. Both options will have free-text entry for precise choices. On mobile clients, the time picker and date
picker will use native UIs.
