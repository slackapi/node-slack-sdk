# Interface: MarkdownBlock

Defined in: [block-kit/blocks.ts:277](https://github.com/slackapi/node-slack-sdk/blob/main/packages/types/src/block-kit/blocks.ts#L277)

## Description

This block can be used with AI apps when you expect a markdown response from an LLM that can get lost in
translation rendering in Slack. Providing it in a markdown block leaves the translating to Slack to ensure your message
appears as intended. Note that passing a single block may result in multiple blocks after translation.

## See

[Markdown block reference](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/blocks#markdown).

#### Description

A string acting as a unique identifier for a block. If not specified, a `block_id` will be generated.
You can use this `block_id` when you receive an interaction payload to
[identify the source of the action](https://docs.slack.dev/interactivity/handling-user-interaction#payloads).
Maximum length for this field is 255 characters. `block_id` should be unique for each message and each iteration of
a message. If a message is updated, use a new `block_id`.
