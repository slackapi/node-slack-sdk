# Migrating to v4.x

This migration guide helps you transition an application written using the `v3.x` series of this package, to the `v4.x` series. This guide focuses specifically on the breaking changes to help get your existing app up and running as quickly as possible. In some cases, there may be better techniques for accomplishing what your app already does by utilizing brand new features or new API methods. Learn about all the new features in our [`v4.0.0` release notes](https://github.com/slackapi/node-slack-sdk/releases/tag/v4.0.0) if you'd like to go beyond a simple port.

## WebClient

### Constructor

*  The `slackAPIUrl` option has been renamed to `slackApiUrl` to improve readability.
*  The `transport` option has been removed. If you used this option to implement proxy support, use the new `agent` option as described [below](#proxy-support-with-agent). If you used this option for setting custom TLS configuration, use the new `tls` option as described [below](#custom-tls-configuration). If you were using this for some other reason, please [open an issue](https://github.com/slackapi/node-slack-sdk/issues/new) and describe your use case so we can help you migrate.

### All methods

All Web API methods no longer take positional arguments. They each take one argument, an object, in which some properties are required and others are optional (depending on the method). You no longer have to memorize or look up the order of the arguments. The method arguments are described in the [API method documentation](/reference/methods). If you are using an editor that understands TypeScript or JSDoc annotations, your editor may present you with useful information about these arguments as you type.

If any Web API method is called with a callback parameter, and the call results in an error from the platform, you will no longer get the platform's response as the second argument to the callback. Instead, that response will exist as the `.data` property on the first argument (the error). You can consolidate this logic by using Promises instead (or continue to use callbacks if you prefer).

**Before:**

```javascript
const { WebClient } = require('@slack/client')
const web = new WebClient(token);

web.chat.postMessage(channelId, text, { as_user: true, parse: 'full' }, (error, resp) => {
  if (error) {
    if (resp) {
      // a platform error occurred, `resp.error` contains the error information
    }
    // some other error occurred
    return;
  }

  // success
});
```

**After:**

```javascript
// a new export, ErrorCode, is a dictionary of known error types
const { WebClient, ErrorCode } = require('@slack/client')
const web = new WebClient(token);

web.chat.postMessage({ channel: channelId, text, as_user: true, parse: 'full' })
  .then((resp) => { /* success */ })
  .catch((error) => {
    if (error.code === ErrorCode.PlatformError) {
      // a platform error occurred, `error.message` contains error information, `error.data` contains the entire resp
    } else {
      // some other error occurred
    }
  });
```

### `dm` methods

This family of methods was always a duplicate of those under the `.im` family. These duplicates have been removed.

### `mpdm` methods

This family of methods was always a duplicate of those under the `.mpim` family. These duplicates have been removed.

## `RTMClient`

The top-level export name has changed from `RtmClient` to `RTMClient`.

### Constructor

*  The `slackAPIUrl` option has been renamed to `slackApiUrl` to improve readability.
*  The `dataStore` option has been removed.
*  The `useRtmConnect` option now has a default value of `true`. We recommend querying for additional data using a `WebClient` after this client is connected. If that doesn't help, then you can set this option to `false`.
*  The `socketFn` option has been removed. If you used this option to implement proxy support, use the new `agent` option as described [below](#proxy-support-with-agent). If you used this option for setting custom TLS configuration, use the new `tls` option as described [below](#custom-tls-configuration). If you were using this for some other reason, please [open an issue](https://github.com/slackapi/node-slack-sdk/issues/new) and describe your use case so we can help you migrate.
*  The `wsPingInterval` and `maxPongInterval` options have been replaced with `clientPingTimeout` and `serverPongTimeout`. Most likely, you can replace these values respectively, or drop using them all together.

### `dataStore`

The v3.15.0 release of `@slack/client` has deprecated use of the `SlackDataStore` interface and its implementations (including `SlackMemoryDataStore`). In v4.0.0 ([release milestone](https://github.com/slackapi/node-slack-sdk/milestone/2)), these types and APIs have been removed.

The datastore APIs have helped apps keep track of team state since this feature was released. But as the Slack platform has evolved, the model has become out of date in tricky and unexpected ways. The data store was designed to behave like the Slack web and desktop applications, managing the type of state that a logged in human user would typically need. But bots and Slack apps have a whole new (and more powerful in many ways) perspective of the world!

At a high level, here are the design issues that could not be addressed in a backwards compatible way:

- **Synchronous calling convention** - In order to plug in storage destinations other than memory (`SlackMemoryDataStore`), the code to reach that destination would need to be asynchronous. This is important if you want to share state across many processes while horizontally scaling an app. As a result, the maintainers have never seen an implementation of the `SlackDataStore` interface other than the memory-based one provided.

- **Names versus IDs** - While we always thought it was a good idea to use IDs anywhere possible in programmatic use, the Slack platform wasn't overly strict about it. With the introduction of Shared Channels, we cannot preserve any guarantees of uniqueness for usernames, as we mentioned in this [changelog entry](/changelog/2017-09-the-one-about-usernames). In fact, channel names also lose these types of guarantees. The APIs in the `SlackDataStore` that operate on names instead of IDs start to break since the fundamental assumptions are not true anymore.

- **Missing Users** - We want the SDK to be clear and easy to use across many use cases, including applications developed for Enterprise Grid and Shared Channels. In this context, an application is likely to receive events from users it does not recognize and for whom it cannot get more information. `SlackDataStore` cannot deal with these scenarios. If your application has more than one RTM client connected to different workspaces, and those workspaces are joined by a shared channel, there is no general purpose way to deduplicate the messages and arrive at a consistent deterministic state. The Slack platform has solved for this issue using the Events API (which deduplicates events on your app's behalf).

For the full discussion, see [#330](https://github.com/slackapi/node-slack-sdk/issues/330).

When you initialize an `RtmClient` object, turn on the `useRtmConnect` option and turn off the `dataStore` option as below:

```javascript
const { RtmClient } = require('@slack/client');

const rtm = new RtmClient('your-token-here', {
  useRtmConnect: true,
  dataStore: false,
});
```

Next look through your code for any places you might reference the `.dataStore` property of the `RtmClient`. In most cases, you'll be able to replace finding data in the dataStore with finding that data using a `WebClient`.

```javascript
const { RtmClient, WebClient } = require('@slack/client');
const web = new WebClient('your-token-here');

// Before:
// const channel = rtm.dataStore.getChannelById(channelId);
// console.log(`channel info: ${JSON.stringify(channel)}`);

// After:
web.conversations.info(channelId)
  .then(resp => console.log(`channel info: ${JSON.stringify(resp.channel)}`)
  .catch(error => /* TODO: handle error */);
```

If you aren't sure how to translate a specific data store method into a Web API call, file a new `question` issue and we will help you figure it out.

You'll notice that this code has become asynchronous. This will likely be the largest challenge in migrating away from the data store, but for most developers it will be worth it.

For the majority of apps, you will be ready for v4 at this point. If your app is having performance related issues, there's room to make improvements by caching the data that is relevant to your app. This should only be taken on if you believe it's necessary, since cache invalidation is one of the [only two hard things in computer science](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html).

The approach for caching data that we recommend is to pick out the data your app needs, store it at connection time, and update it according to a determined policy. You may want to disable the `useRtmConnect` option in order
to get more data at connection time.

### `reconnect()`

This method has been removed, but it can be substituted by using `disconnect()`, waiting for the `disconnected` event, and then calling `start(options)`. Reconnecting using the method was rarely used by developers, and its implementation increased the complexity of state management in the client.

**Before:**

```javascript
rtm.reconnect();
```

**After:**

```javascript
rtm.disconnect();
// You will need to store the start options from the first time you connect and then reuse them here.
rtm.once('disconnected', () => rtm.start(options));
```

### `updateMessage()`

This method has been removed from the `RTMClient`, but can be substituted by using the `WebClient`.

**Before:**

```javascript
const message = { ts: '999999999.0000000', channel: 'C123456', text: 'updated message text' };
rtm.updateMessage(message).then(console.log);
```

**After:**

```javascript
// We recommend that you initialize this object at the same time you would have initialized the RTMClient
const web = new WebClient(token);

const message = { ts: '999999999.0000000', channel: 'C123456', text: 'updated message text' };
web.chat.update(message).then(console.log);
```

### `send()`

This method has be repurposed, and in most cases you will instead rely on `addOutgoingEvent(awaitReply, type, body)`.

The main difference is that if you want to know when the message is acknowledged by the server (you were using the optional callback parameter to `send()`), you'll only be able to do so using the returned Promise. If you prefer callbacks, you can translate the interface using a library like Bluebird (see: http://bluebirdjs.com/docs/api/ascallback.html) or the Node [`util.callbackify()`](https://nodejs.org/api/util.html#util_util_callbackify_original) since v8.2.0.

As an added benefit, you will be able to send the message without worrying whether the client is in a connected state or not.

**Before:**

```javascript
const message = { type: 'message_type', key: 'value', foo: 'bar' };
rtm.send(message, (error, resp) => {
  if (error) {
    // error handling
    return;
  }
  // success handling
});
```

**After:**

```javascript
const message = { type: 'message_type', key: 'value', foo: 'bar' };
rtm.addOutgoingEvent(true, message.type, message)
  .then((resp) => {
    // success handling
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // error handling
  });
```

### Events {#events}

The `RTMClient` now has more well-defined states (and substates) that you may observe using the [`EventEmitter` API pattern](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html). The following table helps describe the relationship between events in the `v3.x` series and events in the `v4.x` series.

| Event Name (`v4.x`) | Event Name (`v3.x`) | Description |
|-----------------|-----------------|-------------|
| `disconnected`  | `disconnect`    | The client is not connected to the platform. This is a steady state - no attempt to connect is occurring. |
| `connecting`    | `connecting` / `attempting_reconnect`   | The client is in the process of connecting to the platform. |
| `authenticated` | `authenticated` | The client has authenticated with the platform. The `rtm.connect` or `rtm.start` response is emitted as an argument. This is a sub-state of `connecting`. |
| `connected`     |                 | The client is connected to the platform and incoming events will start being emitted. |
| `ready`         | `open`          | The client is ready to send outgoing messages. This is a sub-state of `connected` |
| `disconnecting` |                 | The client is no longer connected to the platform and cleaning up its resources. It will soon transition to `disconnected`. |
| `reconnecting`  |                 | The client is no longer connected to the platform and cleaning up its resources. It will soon transition to `connecting`. |
| `error`         | `ws_error`      | An error has occurred. The error is emitted as an argument. The `v4` event is a super set of the `v3` event. To test whether the event is a websocket error, check `error.code === ErrorCodes.RTMWebsocketError` |
| `unable_to_rtm_start` | `unable_to_rtm_start` | A problem occurred while connecting, a reconnect may or may not occur. Use of this event is discouraged since `disconnecting` and `reconnecting` are more meaningful. |
| `slack_event`   |                 | An incoming Slack event has been received. The event type and event body are emitted as the arguments. |
| `{type}`        | `{type}`        | An incoming Slack event of type `{type}` has been received. The event is emitted as an argument. An example is `message` for all message events |
| `{type}::{subtype}` | `{type}::{subtype}` | An incoming Slack event of type `{type}` and subtype `{subtype}` has been received. The event is emitted as an argument. An example is `message::bot_message` for all bot messages. |
| `raw_message`   | `raw_message`   | A websocket message arrived. The message (unparsed string) is emitted as an argument. Use of this event is discouraged since `slack_event` is more useful. |
|                 | `ws_opening`    | This event is no longer emitted, and the state of the underlying websocket is considered private. |
|                 | `ws_opened`     | This event is no longer emitted, and the state of the underlying websocket is considered private. |
|                 | `ws_close`      | This event is no longer emitted, and the state of the underlying websocket is considered private. |

## Incoming webhooks

*  The following options have been renamed:
   - `iconEmoji` => `icon_emoji`
   - `iconUrl` => `icon_url`
   - `linkNames` => `link_names`
   - `unfurlLinks` => `unfurl_links`
   - `unfurlMedia` => `unfurl_media`

## Removed constants

The `CLIENT_EVENTS`, `RTM_EVENTS` and `RTM_MESSAGE_SUBTYPES` constants have been removed. We recommend using simple strings for event names. The values that were in `CLIENT_EVENTS` have been migrated according to the [events table above](#events). The `RTM_EVENTS` dictionary isn't necessary, just directly subscribe to the event name as a string.

**Before:**
```javascript
rtm.on(CLIENT_EVENTS.RTM.AUTHENTICATED, (connectionData) => {
  console.log('RTMClient authenticated');
});

rtm.on(RTM_EVENTS.MESSAGE, (event) => {
  console.log(`Incoming message: ${event.ts}`);
})
```

**After:**
```javascript
rtm.on('authenticated', (connectionData) => {
  console.log('RTMClient authenticated');
});

rtm.on('message', (event) => {
  console.log(`Incoming message: ${event.ts}`);
})
```

## `RETRY_POLICIES`

The names of these policies have slightly changed for more consistency with our style guide. The dictionary of policies is now exported under the name `retryPolicies`. See `src/retry-policies.ts` for details.

## Proxy support with `agent`

In order to pass outgoing requests from `WebClient` or `RTMClient` through an HTTP proxy, you'll first need to install an additional package in your application:

```
$ npm install --save https-proxy-agent
```

Next, use the `agent` option in the client constructor to configure with your proxy settings.

```javascript
const HttpsProxyAgent = require('https-proxy-agent');
const { WebClient, RTMClient } = require('@slack/client');

// in this example, we read the token from an environment variable. It's best practice to keep sensitive data outside
// your source code.
const token = process.env.SLACK_TOKEN;

// it's common to read the proxy URL from an environment variable, since it also may be sensitive.
const proxyUrl = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://12.34.56.78:9999';

// To use Slack's Web API:
const web = new WebClient(token, { agent: new HttpsProxyAgent(proxyUrl) });

// To use Slack's RTM API:
const rtm = new RTMClient(token, { agent: new HttpsProxyAgent(proxyUrl) });

// NOTE: for a more complex proxy configuration, see the https-proxy-agent documentation:
// https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent#api
```

## Custom TLS configuration

You may want to use a custom TLS configuration if your application needs to send requests through a server with a
self-signed certificate.

Example:

```javascript
const { WebClient, RTMClient } = require('@slack/client');

// in this example, we read the token from an environment variable. it's best practice to keep sensitive data outside
// your source code.
const token = process.env.SLACK_TOKEN;

// Configure TLS options
const tls = {
  key: fs.readFileSync('/path/to/key'),
  cert: fs.readFileSync('/path/to/cert'),
  ca: fs.readFileSync('/path/to/cert'),
};

const web = new WebClient(token, { slackApiUrl: 'https://fake.slack.com/api', tls });
const rtm = new RTMClient(token, { slackApiUrl: 'https://fake.slack.com/api', tls });
```
