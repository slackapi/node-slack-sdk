# Slack Types

The `@slack/types` package is intended to be used as a central location for modeling Slack interfaces, types, payloads
and constructs of all kinds.

## Requirements

This package supports Node v18 and higher. It's highly recommended to use [the latest LTS version of
node](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#release-schedule), and the documentation is written using syntax and features
from that version.

## Installation

```shell
$ npm install @slack/types
```

## Usage

This package exports a many different types and interfaces. It is best to peruse the source code to see what is
available, but a brief list:

- Block Kit blocks and elements (`./src/block-kit/*`)
- Message attachments (`./src/message-attachments.ts`)
