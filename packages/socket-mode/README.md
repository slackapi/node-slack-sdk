# Slack Socket Mode

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/slackapi/node-slack-sdk/graph/badge.svg?token=OcQREPvC7r&flag=socket-mode)](https://codecov.io/gh/slackapi/node-slack-sdk)

This package is designed to support [**Socket Mode**][socket-mode], which allows your app to receive events from Slack over a WebSocket connection.

## Requirements

This package supports Node v18 and higher. It's highly recommended to use [the latest LTS version of
node](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#release-schedule), and the documentation is written using syntax and features from that version.

## Installation

```shell
$ npm install @slack/socket-mode
```

## Usage

### Initialize the client

The package exports a `SocketModeClient` class. Your app will create an instance of the class for each workspace it communicates with. Creating an instance requires an [**app-level token**][app-token] from Slack. Apps connect to the **Socket Mode** API using an [**app-level token**][app-token], which starts with `xapp`.

Note: **Socket Mode** requires the `connections:write` scope. Navigate to your [app configuration](https://api.slack.com/apps) and go to the bottom of the **Basic Information** section to create an App token with the `connections:write` scope.


```javascript
const { SocketModeClient } = require('@slack/socket-mode');

// Read a token from the environment variables
const appToken = process.env.SLACK_APP_TOKEN;

// Initialize
const client = new SocketModeClient({appToken});
```

### Connect to Slack

Connecting is as easy as calling the `.start()` method.

```javascript
const { SocketModeClient } = require('@slack/socket-mode');
const appToken = process.env.SLACK_APP_TOKEN;

const socketModeClient = new SocketModeClient({appToken});

(async () => {
  // Connect to Slack
  await socketModeClient.start();
})();
```

### Listen for an event

If you've used Node's [`EventEmitter`](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_class_eventemitter) pattern
before, then you're already familiar with how this works, since the client is an `EventEmitter`.

The `event` argument passed to the listener is an object. Its contents correspond to the [type of
event](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/events) it's registered for.

```javascript
const { SocketModeClient } = require('@slack/socket-mode');
const appToken = process.env.SLACK_APP_TOKEN;

const socketModeClient = new SocketModeClient({appToken});

// Attach listeners to events by type. See: https://docs.slack.dev/reference/events/message
socketModeClient.on('message', (event) => {
  console.log(event);
});

(async () => {
  await socketModeClient.start();
})();
```

### Send a message

To respond to events and send messages back into Slack, we recommend using the `@slack/web-api` package with a [bot token](https://docs.slack.dev/authentication/tokens#bot).

```javascript
const { SocketModeClient } = require('@slack/socket-mode');
const { WebClient } = require('@slack/web-api');

const socketModeClient = new SocketModeClient(process.env.SLACK_APP_TOKEN);
const webClient = new WebClient(process.env.BOT_TOKEN);

// Attach listeners to events by type. See: https://docs.slack.dev/reference/events/message
socketModeClient.on('member_joined_channel', async ({event, body, ack}) => {
    try {
      // send acknowledgement back to slack over the socketMode websocket connection
      // this is so slack knows you have received the event and are processing it
      await ack();
      await webClient.chat.postMessage({
          blocks: [
          {
            type: 'section',
            text: {
              type: 'mrkdwn',
              text: `Welcome to the channel, <@${event.user}>. We're here to help. Let us know if you have an issue.`,
            },
            accessory: {
              type: 'button',
              text: {
                type: 'plain_text',
                text: 'Get Help',
              },
              value: 'get_help',
            },
          },
        ],
        channel: event.channel,
      });
    } catch (error) {
      console.log('An error occurred', error);
    }
  });
  
(async () => {
  await socketModeClient.start();
})();
```

### Lifecycle events

The client's connection to Slack has a lifecycle. This means the client can be seen as a state machine which transitions through a few states as it connects, disconnects and possibly reconnects with Slack. The client emits an event for each state it transitions to throughout its lifecycle. If your app simply needs to know whether the client is connected or not, the `.connected` boolean property can be checked.

In the table below, the client's states are listed, which are also the names of the events you can use to observe the transition to that state. The table also includes descriptions for the states and arguments that a listener would receive.

| Event Name      | Arguments | Description |
|-----------------|-----------------|-------------|
| `connecting`    |  | The client is in the process of connecting to the platform. |
| `connected`     |  | The client is connected to the platform and incoming events will start being emitted. |
| `disconnecting` |  | The client is no longer connected to the platform and cleaning up its resources. It will soon transition to `disconnected`. |
| `reconnecting`  |  | The client is no longer connected to the platform and cleaning up its resources. It will soon transition to `connecting`. |
| `disconnected`  | `(error)` | The client is not connected to the platform. This is a steady state - no attempt to connect is occurring. The `error` argument will be `undefined` when the client initiated the disconnect (normal). |

The client also emits events that are part of its lifecycle, but aren't states. Instead, they represent specific moments that might be helpful to your app. The following table lists these events, their description, and includes the arguments that a listener would receive.

| Event Name      | Arguments | Description |
|-----------------|-----------|-------------|
| `error`         | `(error)` | An error has occurred. |
| `slack_event`   | `(eventType, event)` | An incoming Slack event has been received. |

### Logging

The `SocketModeClient` will log information to the console by default. You can use the `logLevel` to decide how much or what kind of information should be output. There are a few possible log levels, which you can find in the `LogLevel` export. By default, the value is set to `LogLevel.INFO`. While you're in development, it's sometimes helpful to set this to the most verbose: `LogLevel.DEBUG`.

```javascript
// Import LogLevel from the package
const { SocketModeClient, LogLevel } = require('@slack/socket-mode');
const appToken = process.env.SLACK_APP_TOKEN;

// Log level is one of the options you can set in the constructor
const socketModeClient = new SocketModeClient({
  appToken,
  logLevel: LogLevel.DEBUG,
});

(async () => {
  await socketModeClient.start();
})();
```

All the log levels, in order of most to least information are: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, and `ERROR`.

<strong><i>Sending log output somewhere besides the console</i></strong>
</summary>

You can also choose to have logs sent to a custom logger using the `logger` option. A custom logger needs to implement specific methods (known as the `Logger` interface, see the [`@slack/logger` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@slack/logger) for details). A minimal interface should implement the following methods:

| Method       | Parameters        | Return type |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------|
| `getLevel()` | n/a               | `LogLevel`  |
| `setLevel()` | `level: LogLevel` | `void`      |
| `setName()`  | `name: string`    | `void`      |
| `debug()`    | `...msgs: any[]`  | `void`      |
| `info()`     | `...msgs: any[]`  | `void`      |
| `warn()`     | `...msgs: any[]`  | `void`      |
| `error()`    | `...msgs: any[]`  | `void`      |

A very simple custom logger might ignore the name and level, and write all messages to a file.

```javascript
const { createWriteStream } = require('fs');
const logWritable = createWriteStream('/var/my_log_file'); // Not shown: close this stream

const socketModeClient = new SocketModeClient({
  appToken,
  // Creating a logger as a literal object. It's more likely that you'd create a class.
  logger: {
    debug(...msgs): { logWritable.write('debug: ' + JSON.stringify(msgs)); },
    info(...msgs): { logWritable.write('info: ' + JSON.stringify(msgs)); },
    warn(...msgs): { logWritable.write('warn: ' + JSON.stringify(msgs)); },
    error(...msgs): { logWritable.write('error: ' + JSON.stringify(msgs)); },
    getLevel(): { return 'info'; },
    setLevel(): { },
    setName(): { },
  },
});

(async () => {
  await socketModeClient.start();
})();
```
