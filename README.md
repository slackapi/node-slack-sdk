# Node.js Slack Client Library

## Travis-CI Build Status

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/slackhq/node-slack-client.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/slackhq/node-slack-client)

## Description

This is the beta Slack client 2.0.0 library for node.js, it:
- wraps the [Slack Web API](https://api.slack.com/web) methods
- exposes the [Real Time Messaging API's](https://api.slack.com/rtm) functionality

## Beta Status

Please note that this client is a complete rewrite of the 1.5.1 slack-client library.

It's still under active development, so issues and PRs are very welcome.

There are likely still a number of bugs to address in this release before it's ready for a full 2.0.0, so use with caution!

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save slack-client@2.0.0-beta.2 
```

## Usage
```js

var RtmClient = require('slack-client').RtmClient;

var token = process.env.SLACK_API_TOKEN || '';

var rtm = new RtmClient(token, {logLevel: 'debug'});
rtm.start();

rtm.on('message', function(message) {
    console.log(message);
});

```

A full example of how to use this module from Node.js can be found in the [/examples directory](examples).
